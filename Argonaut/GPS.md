GPS satellites are simply beacons, like lighthouses, that a device can use to calculate its latitude and longitude

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a U.S.-owned utility that provides users with positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. This system consists of three segments: the space segment, the control segment, and the user segment. The U.S. Air Force develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments.

Space Segment
satellite The space segment consists of a nominal constellation of 24 operating satellites that transmit one-way signals that give the current GPS satellite position and time.

The United States is committed to maintaining the availability of at least 24 operational GPS satellites, 95% of the time.

This 24-slot arrangement ensures users can view at least four satellites from virtually any point on the planet.

As of April 24, 2019, there were a total of 31 operational satellites in the GPS constellation, not including the decommissioned, on-orbit spares.
 
Like the Internet, GPS is an essential element of the global information infrastructure. The free, open, and dependable nature of GPS has led to the development of hundreds of applications affecting every aspect of modern life

GPS positioning works on two basic mathematical concepts. The first is called trilateration, which literally means positioning from three distances. The second concept is the relationship between distance traveled, rate (speed) of travel and amount of time spent traveling, or:

Distance = Rate Ã— Time

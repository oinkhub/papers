Argonaut doesn't track your activity in anyway, that includes analytics or any other kind of information.

Argonaut doesn't store anything from you.

When you create a map this will be completely confidential and only stored in your device. Argonaut will know nothing about it.

If you decide to allow Argonaut to access your location this will only be used to provide navigation and to enable map functionalities. In no way Argonaut stores nor shares your location.

Argonaut respects if you still prefer not to allow access to your location and will try to be useful for you, this is not a stopper.

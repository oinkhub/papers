- Starting in iOS 13 every MKMapSnapshotter has the watermark of Apple in the left bottom corner.
- Apparently MKMapView is optimised so tiles bigger than 512x512pixels are not rendering correctly, better to use smaller tiles.
- Starting in iOS 13 MKMapSnapshotter fails if you try to generate an image bigger than 2560x2560 and it seems you also get blocked for not trying again.
- iOS 13 min zoom level is 2

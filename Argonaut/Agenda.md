# Problem
- BVG, official app for public transport in Berlin.
We don't know what options we have.
-- Train stations
-- Which one is closer
-- How do we go to from a known location to another
-- We can see a map

- Northern, app for trains in the United Kingdom.

# Problem
We make apps that navigate you, if you are online.

## Overlooking
- Traveling abroad
- Bad signal
- You don't want to use your mobile data

## But also
- You don't have a subscription

Mobile Internet is not equally accessible to everyone.

ITU (International Telecommunication Union)
by the United Nations

LCDs (Least developed countries)


## What can we do?
- We can have static information
-- Stations
-- Schedules, maybe
-- Landmarks

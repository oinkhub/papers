# Git on the Mobile

git on Swift

# Problem
There is no friendly way of versioning your information.

If you want to track changes to our documents on a desktop we have multiple tools for it. To achieve it on mobile we don't have many options 
nor there is a friendly way of handling it.

# Solution
Git is an app that implements git version control system natively for both iOS and MacOS with Swift.

# Defence
Being a native app implementing the git capabilities is it possible to provide the full power of version controlling made available by git but without the great complexity that comes by using it on a Terminal.

# Related work
There are a few options on the App Store, unfortunately most of them try to emulate the experience of using git over a Terminal, which is not really what an iPhone user expects.
